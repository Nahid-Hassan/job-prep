## Introduction

Your interviewers haven't seen red-black trees since they were in school either. To crack the coding interview, you need to prepare with real interview questions. You must practice on real problems and learn their patterns. **It's about developing a fresh algorithm, not memorizing existing problems. The interviewer is looking to evaluate your ability to solve algorithmic problems you haven't seen before.**

Rather, your interviewer will make an assessment of your performance, usually based on the following:

- **Analytical skills**: Did you need much help solving the problem? How optimal was your solution? How
long did it take you to arrive at a solution? If you had to design/architect a new solution, did you struc­ture the problem well and think through the tradeoffs of different decisions?

- **Coding skills**: Were you able to successfully translate your algorithm to reasonable code? Was it clean and well-organized? Did you think about potential errors? Did you use good style?

- **Technical knowledge/ Computer Science fundamentals**: Do you have a strong foundation in computer
science and the relevant technologies?

- **Experience**: Have you made good technical decisions in the past? Have you built interesting, challenging projects? Have you shown drive, initiative, and other important factors?

- **Culture fit/ Communication skills**: Do your personality and values fit with the company and team? Did you communicate well with your interviewer?

The weighting of these areas will vary based on the question, interviewer, role, team, and company. In a standard algorithm question, it might be almost entirely the first three of those.


Some points,

- Why do things this way???
- Basic data structure and algorithm knowledge is useful (tree, graphs, list, sorting).
- **Whiteboards** also tend to encourage candidates to speak more and explain their thought process. When a candidate is given a computer, their communication drops substantially.
- At the vast majority of companies, there are no lists of what interviewers should ask. Rather, each **inter­viewer selects their own questions**.
- **Algorithms** and **System Designs** (for their perspectives)

> **LuCky vs UnluCKy**: For example, suppose you came up with some cool new brainteaser or math problem. You ask your friend Alex the question, and it takes him 30 minutes to solve it. You ask Bella and she takes 50 minutes. Chris is never able to solve it. Dexter takes 15 minutes, but you had to give him some major hints and he probably would have taken far longer without them. Ellie takes 10-and comes up with an alternate approach you weren't even aware of. Fred takes 35 minutes. You'll walk away saying, "Wow, Ellie did really well. I'll bet she's pretty good at math:' (Of course, she could have just gotten lucky. And maybe Chris got unlucky. You might ask a few more questions just to really make sure that it wasn't good or bad luck.)
