Application
I applied online. The process took 3 months. I interviewed at WellDev (Dhaka) in Jan 2023

Interview
The interview process started at mid October ended in mid January next year. Approximately It took 3 months. A technical mcq assessment, 2nd interview consisting a HR session and technical round and third interview usually a technical round. After getting passed the previous rounds, I got call for the final "technical" round. I was expecting a technical coding round, whereas what I got I mere basic questions and database conceptual questions. I asked the interviewer whether there were any technical part coming forth. Interviewer said, "No". I was a bit confused, after the interview. As you couldn't predict the outcome beforehand where the interview was pretty basic. I felt little about suspicious about it. I was correct about my gut feeling. I got the rejection mail after two days.

Interview Questions
In the mcq round: Basic DS, analytical questions, copied from Internet. In the HR round: basic questions about yourself and your future plan. In the first technical round: basic problem solving. In the third round: Some question answering stuffs (eg: databse, your projects) instead of coding round.
