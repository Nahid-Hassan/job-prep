Interview
1st round - 15 minute coding interview, easiest questions, like find average of an array without max,min. This coding was done in shared doc, no IDE/text editor 2nd Round - 1h coding interview, 2-3 question, around 20min each, little bit harder problems, recursion,string manipulation, maybe some tree, stack etc. This coding was done in interviewee's computer via team teamviewer like remote control software, in C#, Visual Studio The interviewee was helpful throughout the process and guided clearly. If goes well, then HR interview, basically they ask about availability for the job, then recruit.
